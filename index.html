                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I'm a small suburban town girl living with my family in the huge region the world knows as "Silicon Valley." Originally aiming for a career in mass media, I discovered the wonderful wide world of the web just about a year before I earned my BA degree as a new form of medium alongside print, TV, and the radio. But rather than using this new medium for content and information to the masses, I became more interested in the early stages of building this new medium than filling in the blanks. It was that time that I delved myself deeper into web design and development.</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I have many hobbies and interests and I made side projects and mock sites based on those interests. It was then that I discovered that I do have the inspiration and the means of building websites, not just for myself, but for everyone who wants one or needs one. By word of mouth, I have been building and maintaining sites for others, as well as being able to write about my journeys and teaching others the passion as I do.s</p>
